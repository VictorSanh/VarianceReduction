# VarianceReduction
This is the implementation of a variance reduction method based on importance sampling for Monte Carlo application in finance.
The code is an implementation of an algorithm described in the following paper : Robust Adaptative Importance Sampling for Normal Random Vectors ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.1496.pdf ).

In the simulation, the algorithm was used to calculate the price of a basket option. The variance was drastically reduced (divided by 5 to 10).
